What do the Users want and why?

The Users want an app that is used specifically for only keeping track of client information without them having to save information in their personal phones, 
computers and other personal devices. 

User Stories:
I want to be able to easily add, update or delete a client.
I want to be able to add an image of my client.
I want each client to have a special code that I can reference every time they send a referral to me. 
I want to be a ble to look up a client by their name, city, phone number or code.

General Approach:

I wanted to create a quick and simple way of entering and saving clients into a database. 

Obstacles:
Unable to deploy Angular.
Dom error. I refactored my code but just didn't have enough time to research the problem more solutions since there were no errors with my code displaying.
